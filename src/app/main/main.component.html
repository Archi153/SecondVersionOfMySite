            Oh yeah it's me...  My name is Andrey, i'm from Russia, and i'm a frontend developer. i've been doing this for 3 years. 
            This is such an interesting story about my journey in the frontend. It started when I was in the 11th grade, then I met a Junior frontend developer who was almost 36 years old, he started doing this when he was 35 and I realized that if people can change their lives at that age, then I can learn something. He showed me some projects and I got interested in it. After some time, I started learning the basics of html and css. I still look at it like for the first time
